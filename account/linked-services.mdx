# How to manage services linked to my user account?

## Problem

I created my OnePass account and decided to use a passkey to authenticate, but I would like to use my Google account to sign in instead from now on. How can I link this service to my account and remove the passkey?

## Solution  

Some third-party apps or services let you link your OnePass Account to improve your experience but, when you link your OnePass account with a third-party account, the third party may share info with OnePass (the third party may tell you what kind of info they share). To link a third-party service to your OnePass account, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your OnePass account,  
2. Navigate to the "Account Settings" page by clicking on your avatar in the top right corner of the page,  
3. Click on the "Security" option,  
4. Under the "Third-Party Apps" section, click on the "Link" button.  
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to grant the third-party app access to your OnePass account.  
6. Once the process is complete, the third-party app will be listed under the "Third-Party Apps" section.  

You can unlink services you no longer trust or use. To revoke a third-party app's access to your OnePass account, follow these steps:  

1. Log in to your OnePass account,  
2. Navigate to the "Account Settings" page by clicking on your avatar in the top right corner of the page,  
3. Click on the "Security" option,  
4. Under the "Third-Party Apps" section, find the app you wish to revoke access for,  
5. Click on the "Unlink" button next to the app name.  

## Notes  

It's important to manage these apps carefully to ensure the security of your account.
