# How to change my password?  

## Problem  

When I created my account, I used a weak password and I would like to change it now, but I don't know how.  

## Solution  

1. Sign in to your OnePass account,  
2. Navigate to the "Account Settings" by clicking on your avatar on the upper right corner of the screen,  
3. Click on the "Security" option,  
4. In the section "Change password", type your current password, the new password, and confirm new password in the respective text boxes, and  
5. Hit the "Change password" button at the end of this section.

## Notes  

Keep in mind that the password should have at least 8 characters, including at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit and one special character, and be carefull to avoid spelling mistakes when repeating your new password.

If you forgot your password, you can also reset it using the "[Forgot your password?](https://app.getonepass.eu/forgot-password)" link that will be shown during the sign in process, after entering your email address.  

Notice also that, until you select an authentication method in your user account (password, passkey, or external IdP), you will be sent a one-time use code to your email account every time you sign in. This code will be valid for 10 minutes and can be used only once.
