# How to sign out of my user account?

## Problem

## Solution

Signing out of OnePass is a simple process that helps protect your account security. To sign out of OnePass, follow these steps:

1. Click on your profile picture or initials in the top right corner of the page.
2. Click on the Logout button.

To logout of all other OnePass sessions (in other browsers or computers), follow these steps:

1. Log in to your OnePass account,  
2. Navigate to the "Account Settings" page,  
3. Click on the "Security" tab, and  
4. Scroll to the bottom of the central screen and, under the "Sign out of all other sessions" section, click on the "Sign out other sessions" button.

## Notes  

By signing out of all other sessions, you ensure that your account is secure and that no one else can access it from other browsers or computers.
