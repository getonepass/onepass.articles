# How to use a passkey to sign in?  

## Problem  

I would like to sign in to my OnePass account in an easier way. How can I do it?  

## Solution  

Passkeys are a password replacement that validates your identity using touch, facial recognition, a device password, or a PIN. Passkeys can be used for sign in as a simple and secure alternative to your password and two-factor credentials. To set up a passkey as your authentication method to access your OnePass account, you have to:  

1. Sign in to your OnePass account,  
2. Navigate to the "Account Settings" page by clicking on your avatar in the top right corner of the page,  
3. Click on the "Security" option,  
4. Under the "Passkey" section, click on the black "Create a Passkey" button,  
5. A dialogue box will appear, prompting you to create a passkey. Choose where do you want to store your passkey and click "Create".  
6. Define if which type of pin you want to assign to your passkey, type a pin and click "Confirm".  
7. The new passkey will be listed on the "Passkey" section of your account settings from now on.  

You can remove the passkey at any point, by clicking the black button "Delete Passkey" to the right of the passkey name.  

## Notes  

Notice also that, until you select an authentication method in your user account (password, passkey, or external IdP), you will be sent a one-time use code to your email account every time you sign in. This code will be valid for 10 minutes and can be used only once.
