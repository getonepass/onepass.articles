# How to change the primary email address of my user account?

## Problem  

When I created my account, I used a generic email and I would like to replace that by an individual one now, but I don't know how.

## Solution  

In order to change the primary email address of a user account, you have to add a new alternate email, verify it, and then remove the old primary email. Here's how:  

1. Sign in to your OnePass account.
2. Navigate to the "Account Settings" by clicking on your avatar on the upper right corner of the screen,
3. Under the "Account" option, enter your email address in the text box and click on the "Add new email address" button.
4. Check your email inbox for a verification email from OnePass.
5. Click on the verification link in the email to verify your email address.
6. Click the red "Remove" button next to the old primary email address to remove it from your account.

## Notes  

It's important to regularly review your linked email addresses and remove any that are no longer needed. If you encounter any issues during this process, please contact our support team for assistance.
