# How to define if and when to be notified by OnePass?

## Problem  

I opted out of all notifications from OnePass, but I would like to receive some of them again. How can I do that?

## Solution  

In the notifications preferences you will be able to set up if you want to be notified about new features in OnePass and if you want to receive OnePass Newsletter:

1. Sign in to your OnePass account,  
2. Navigate to the "Account Settings" by clicking on your avatar on the upper right corner of the screen,  
3. Click on the "Notifications" option, and  
4. Click on the checkbox of the option(s) you want to activate.  

## Notes  

Remember that you can modify your preferences at any point and notice that, even if you opt out of all options, OnePass still send you important administrative emails and account-related notifications, like password resets.
