# Can I sign up using a third party app?

## Problem

I already have different users for too many tools. I would rather prefer to sign up to OnePass using a passkey, how can I do it?

## Solution  

OnePass allows you to sign in using external identity providers (IdPs) such as Google, Passkey, LinkedIn, or FundingBox. This feature enables you to use your existing accounts with these providers to access OnePass without creating a separate username and password.
To sign-up to OnePass using an external identity provider (IdP) such as Google, a Passkey, LinkedIn, or FundingBox, follow these steps:

1. Visit the [OnePass sign-in](https://app.getonepass.eu/signin),
2. Select the tab for your preferred IdP (Google, Passkey, LinkedIn, or FundingBox),
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to grant OnePass access to your IdP account, and  
4. Once the process is complete, you will be redirected to your OnePass homepage.

## Notes  

**Important Information Regarding Sign On Methods**: Please note that if you sign in using an external identity provider, you will only be able to sign in using that same IdP. If you would like to add additional sign-in mechanisms, such as the ability to sign in using a combination of email and password, you will need to link or activate the specific mechanism within your account settings.
