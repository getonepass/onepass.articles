# How to add a new email address?

## Problem  

When I created my account, I used a generic email and I would like to add an individual one now, but I don't know how.

## Solution  

By default, all OnePass users are required to link a work email address to their account, which must be verified, but users may add additional alternate email addresses. To add an alternate email address, follow these steps:  

1. Sing in to your OnePass account,  
2. Navigate to the "Account Settings" by clicking on your avatar on the upper right corner of the screen,  
3. Under the "Account" option, enter your email address in the text box and click on the "Add new email address" button,  
4. Check your email inbox for a verification email from OnePass, and  
5. Click on the verification link in the email to verify your email address.  

## Notes  

If you can't see the verification e-mail in your inbox, please, check your spam folder.  
If you didn't receive the verification email, please contact our support team for assistance.  

By managing your user account emails, you ensure that you can always access your OnePass account and receive important notifications.
