# What is a user profile?

Your user profile is the public information that you provide about yourself on OnePass, i.e. it's your business card in OnePass. You will only be required your proffesional email account (work email), your first name and your last name to create a user profile, but there is some aditional information you can fill to customize your profile and make it more appealing:

- Profile image (an image or avatar that will work as an icon for your profile),  
- Headline (a one-sentence description of your role and experience),  
- Location (type the name of the city where you are based),  
- Bio (a few lines of your professional trajectory), and  
- Job search status (mark the correponding radio button to indicate if you are looking for a job or not).
