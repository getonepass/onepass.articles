How do I customize my identity for my communications through OnePass?

## Problem

I want to manage my communications through OnePass but I would like the addressees to see my email address in the messages.

## Solution

Follow these steps to add a new sender identity and enable OnePass to send emails on your behalf:  

1. sign in to your OnePass account,
2. navigate to the "Workspace Settings",  
3. click on the "Sender identities" option of the left side menu,  
4. on the central frame, click on the black "Add new email identity" button,  
5. include, at least, the name and email of the sender that you want to add and, if you wish, specify also the email where you want to receive answers,  
6. define if this will be the default sender for that workspace, and  
7. click the black "Add" button.  

Once created, the status of this sender will show to the right of the sender identity name as "Verfied" or "Enabled".  

## Notes  

Be aware that each sender identity requires verification to prevent abuse and maintain deliverability. This means that, after submitting the form to add a sender, you will receive a verification email from AWS, our email infrastructure providerm, that serves to confirm that you have authorized for the addition of the new sender address and allow us to send emails on your behalf.  

Delete any sender identity that you are not using anymore. You can do it by clicking the trash button that will appear to the right of the sender identity mail.
