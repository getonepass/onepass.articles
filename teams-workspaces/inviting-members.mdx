# How do I invite my team to our workspace?

## Problem

I created a workspace for my company and I want to invite some people in my team to help me manage the workspace documents and activity, but I don't know how.

## Solution

If you already have a user account and a workspace and want to invite team members to join, follow these steps:  

1. sign in to your OnePass account,
2. navigate to the "Workspace Settings",
3. click on the "Members" option in the left side menu,  
4. select the "Members" tab below the team summary and hit the black "Invite members" button,
5. type (or paste) the email addresses (separated by commas) of the people you want to invite,
6. select the role you want them to have and
7. click on the "Continue" button.

## Notes

The team members that you add are visible only internally. The "key" team members that will be shown to other users in OnePass are the ones that you include in your profile.

You can include the same members to different workspaces with the same or different roles.
