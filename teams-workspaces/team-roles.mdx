# Which roles should I assign to the team members that I invite?  

## Problem  

I created a workspace for my company and I want to invite some people in my team to help me manage the workspace documents and activity, but I don't know which role I should assign to them.  

## Solution  

As far a you created the workspace, you are the "Workspace Owner" and have full control over the workspace, including inviting and managing members. You can assign the following roles to the team members you invite:  

1. Admin, with permissios to invite and manage team members, edit workspace settings and access and manage all projects and documents. The only restrictions they will have are sensitive features as closing or deleting the workspace.
2. Team Member, who will be able to zccess and contribute to all projects and documents within the workspace. However, they cannot invite new members or edit workspace settings.  
3. External Collaborator, who will only access the specific projects or items they are assigned to. They cannot view or edit other workspace content.  

## Notes

It's possible to add more than one admin to each workspace, if you need it.
