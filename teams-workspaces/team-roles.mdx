# Which roles should I assign to the team members that I invite?

## Problem

I created a workspace for my company and I want to invite some people in my team to help me manage the workspace documents and activity, but I don't know which role I should assign to them.

## Solution

When you invite a team member, you will be requested to assign a role for them. There are only 3 different roles that you can assign:  

1. admin: this role has full access to all the information and features of the workspace. It's possible to add more than one admin to each workspace, if you need it. 
2. team member: they will also have access to include, change or delete most of the information in your workspace. The only restrictions they will have are sensitive features as closing or deleting the profile and changing or deleting some legal information. 
3. collaborator: this role is for colleagues linked to your workspace that are not part of your organization. They will have limited access to a restricted set of projects with limited features (e.g. they won't be able to edit your workspace settings or your company profile).
