# How do I close a workspace?

## Problem

My previous company transformed into a new one. I have created a workspace for the new company and want to close the one for the previous company.

## Solution

If you want to close a workspace, follow these steps:

1. sign in to your OnePass account,
2. navigate to the "Workspace Settings",
3. click on the "General" option of the left-side menu,
4. in the central frame, scroll down to the "Close this organization" headline and click the "Set as inactive" button to the right, and
5. a pop-up message will appear in a green bubble on the right bottom corner to confirm that changes have been done.
