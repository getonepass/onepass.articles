# How do I create a workspace?

## Problem

I already have a user account, but I don't have a workspace.

## Solution

Once your user account is ready, sign in to OnePass and follow these steps: 
1. click on the "Create an organization workspace" button,
2. provide the minimum mandatory information (this is, name and type of company, country where it's established and a website or domain name) and select the type of profile you want to create, and
3. click on the "Next" button at the bottom to save the information.

## Notes

There is little information that is compulsory to fill to create your workspace but remember that the workspace and your company profile share a good deal of information. This is, the more information you provide at this point, the less you will need to include later.

If you belong to more than one workspace, remember that there is a list of your workspaces in the "Organizations" tab of your user account settings. This list shows the icon of the workspace, its name, your role within that particular workspace and one button to go to each workspace settings and another to leave each of the workspaces.

You can also switch from one workspace to another by clicking on the avatar and name of the workspace that you are using (always in the right upper corner of the page). Once unfolded, the workspaces you belong to will appear beneath the section "Switch context to" and you only have to click on the name of the one you want to switch to.
