# How can I manage requests to access my company's workspace?

## Problem

One of my team members requested access to our company's workspace but I cannot find where to accept their request.

## Solution

To manage access requests, you have to:
1. sign in to your OnePass account,
2. navigate to the "Workspace Settings",
3. click on the "Members" option of the left side menu and, on the central frame beneath the summary on the workspace team, click on the "Access requests" tab,
4. a list including the avatar, name and username of the people requesting access will apppear and,
5. click on the "Accept" (if you want the user to join you) or "Decline" (if you don't) buttons to the right to accept or reject respectively the request.

## Notes

In the event that someone that you did not invite wants to join one of the workspaces that you manage (i.e. if you are an admin), you will receive an access request including the username and name of the person who requested access.
