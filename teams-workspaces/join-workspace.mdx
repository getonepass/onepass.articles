# How do I join an existing workspace?

## Problem

I have noticed that a workspace for my organization already exists, but I don't know how to join it.

## Solution

Once your user account is ready, sign in to OnePass and follow these steps:  

1. click on the "Join an existing workspace" button,  
2. if the workspace you want to join appears under the section "Found for you", just click the "Request to join" button on the right of the workspace name OR,  
3. if not there, type some characters to search for it, click its name when appears, and  
4. click the "Request to join" button on the right of the workspace name.  

You will obtain a confirmation message in the screen when the request is sent successfully.  

## Notes

Try different text chains if your workspace doesn't appear in the first try. The workspace is named after the "Organization name": notice that the person who created it might have used the commercial name of your organization or might have mispelled it by mistake.

Once you request access, the owner of the existing workspace you want to join has to accept your request. Please, be patient: it might not happen in real time.
