## Problem

The name of my workspace contains a spelling mistake and I want to correct it.

## Solution

Once signed in, follow this steps to rename a workspace:  

1. navigate to the "Workspace Settings" page,  
2. click on the "General" option of the left side menu,  
3. look for the "Organization name" headline on the central frame and click the pencil icon to the right of the workspace name,  
4. type a new name for your workspace, and  
5. click the "Save" button (or the cancel one if you change your mind).  

## Notes 

Please, think twice before renaming a workspace as it might have unintended side effects.
