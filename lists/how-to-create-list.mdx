# How can I create a list?  

## Problem  

I am following up a group of startups that I am interested in, but I don't want to look for each of them individually every time I want to check their status. I would like to have a list of them, so I can see them all together and follow up their status.  

## Solution  

The lists feature allows you to create a list of investors, startups, or any other entities you want to track. This is a great way to keep track of your interests and follow up on them easily. You can create a list by following these steps:  

1. Sign in to your OnePass account,  
2. Navigate to the "Source" section in the main menu on the left (if you are a startup, you have to navigate to the "Radar" section instead) and click on the "Lists" option,  
3. Click on the black "Create a new list" button to the right under the welcome message. on the upper right corner of the page,  
4. Provide some details about the list (title, summary and description), and
5. Click on the "Next" button to create the list.

## Notes

The title and summary will appear in the list inventory, while the description will only be visible on the list's details page. All these details can be edited later (by visiting the lists option, clicking on the list you want to edit and then clicking on the "Edit" button).  

An inventory of all your "private" lists and the public ones will be available in the "Lists" section of the "Source" (or "Radar", if you are a startup) section. You can order them (by name) or filter them (by owner or status) using the buttons "Filter by", "Status" or the "Ordering icon" to the right of the headline of the inventory.
