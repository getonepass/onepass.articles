# How can I add items to a list?  

## Problem  

The cofounder of my startup has created a list of investors that we are interested in and asked me to review it and contribute with any other investors that I find interesting, but I don't know how to add items to it.  

## Solution

Navigate to the List
Go to the "Lists" section in the main menu on the left and select the list you want to add items to.

Add Items from the List Details Page

Scroll to the bottom of the list details page to see suggestions.
Click the "Add item" button on the right to manually search and add startups or investors.
Add Items from the Search Dashboard

Use the search feature to find the startup or investor you want to add.
Click the "Add to" button on the upper right corner of the company or investor details view.
Select the list you want to add the item to.
Remove Items if Needed

To remove an item, click the three dots icon on the upper right corner of the item card in the list and select "Remove from the list."
These steps allow you to efficiently manage your lists and keep track of startups or investors of interest.
