# How can I add items to a list?  

## Problem  

The co-founder of my startup has created a list of investors that we are interested in and asked me to review it and contribute with any other investors that I find interesting, but I don't know how to add items to it.  

## Solution

The lists feature in OnePass allows you to create and manage lists of startups or investors. These lists will help you organize and track the companies you are interested in with precision.	You can add companies to relevant lists effortlessly in several ways. 

If you are interested in a particular startup or investor, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your OnePass account.
2. Go to the "Lists" section in the main menu on the left and click on the list you want to add items to.
3. Click on the black "Add items" button located at the top right corner under the list description.
4. Type the name of the startup or investor you want to add in the search bar and select it from the dropdown list.  

You can also add items to a list while conducting a search. If you are a startup looking for investors, you can add them to your list directly from the search results. Hereâ€™s how:  

1. Sign in to your OnePass account,  
2. Hit the "Investors database" heading under "Radar" section in the main menu on the left,  
3. Use the search criteria to segment the investors you are interested in,  
4. When you identify an investor you want to add to your list, click the "Add to" button in the right upper corner of the investor card,  
6. Select the tab "Lists" and choose the list you want to add the investor to.  

If you are an investor and you want to add startups to lists from the search, you can do it in a similar way:
1. Sign in to your OnePass account,  
2. Click on the "Companies" heading under "Source" section in the main menu on the left,  
3. Use the search box and/or the filters to segment the comapanies you are interested in,  
4. When you identify an startup you want to add to your list, click on the name of the company,
5. Hit the black "Add to" button in the right upper corner of the company profile,  
6. Select the tab "Lists" and choose the list you want to add the investor to.  

## Notes

Notice that in the "Lists" tab of each startup or investor, you will see a check to the right of the lists to which this item is already added.

If you are investor, a batch of suggested companies will be displayed to you at the bottom of each list. You can add them easily by clicking on the name of the company and, then, on the black "Add to" button in the right upper corner of the company profile (from this point, the process is the same as described above).   

To remove an item visit the corresponding list, identify the item you want to remove, click the three dots icon on the upper right corner of the item card in the list and select "Remove from the list."
