# What is the watchlist and how to manage it?  

## Problem  

What is the difference between a watchlist and a list? Is the watchlist managed in the same way than the other lists?  

## Solution  

The watchlist is your personalized dashboard to track and monitor the companies that interest you most. A watchlist is created by default for all OnePass users and it will allow you to see the updated information of the companies that you are following.  

It is managed in the same way as the other lists, but this is a private list for you. 

You can add items to the list from the black "Search" button at the bottom (only if the wathlist is still empty), from the black "Add item" button to the right of the headline, from the suggestions in the list below, and from the companies search or the investors database in the "Source" or "Radar" sections. In any of these options, once you get to the company profile, you have to click on the "Add to" button, select the watchlist tab and click on the "Add to watchlist" button.  

To remove items from the list, click on the three dots icon in the upper right corner of the company card and select the "Remove from watchlist" option.  

## Notes  

Notice that the name and description of the watchlist cannot be modified and that, as a private list, cannot be shared or published. 

The suggestions shown in the watchlist are based on your company profile and on the companies you have added to it. If you feels that suggestions are not completely relevant, refine or complete more details in your profile to improve the suggestions.
