 How can I send a direct message?

## Problem

We are a startup and we are collaborating for a specific task with other 2 companies in our network.  We want to create a group chat to share short updates with them. How can we do that?  

## Solution  

There are three types of chats in the messaging system: direct chats, group chats and relay chats. Group chats are conversations between three or more users. Those are private messages to the users in the conversation and won't be shown to the other team members in the workspace.
