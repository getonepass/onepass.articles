# How can I create a group chat?

## Problem

We are a startup and we are collaborating for a specific task with other 2 companies in our network.  We want to create a group chat to share short updates with them. How can we do that?  

## Solution  

There are three types of chats in the messaging system: direct chats, group chats and relay chats. Group chats are conversations between three or more users. Those are private messages to the users in the conversation and won't be shown to the other team members in the workspace. These messages will help you coordinate collaboration with your team and engagement by communicating directly with other users in your network. Whether you're sharing updates or negotiating terms, this secure channel ensures every conversation moves you closer to your objectives.  

To create a group chat, you can:  

1. Sign in to your OnePass account,
2. Go to the "Connect" section in the main left side menu,
3. Click on the button "New group chat" at the bottom left side of the screen, OR click on the "layers" icon to the right of the "Group chats" headline,
4. once the new group window opens, type a title for the group chat,
5. search and select the users you want to add to the group chat, and
6. write your message and click on the black "next" button at the bottom right side of the window.  

You can see the details of each group chat, by clicking on the chat and, then, on the "i" icon in the upper right corner of the chat window.  

It's also possible to add new users to an existing group chat by clicking on the chat and, then, on the user icon in the upper right corner of the chat window.  

On the three dots icon in the upper right corner of the chat window, you will be able to "Edit" the name of the chat, to "Archive" it (if it's an old group that you are not using currently), or to delete it (if you don't need it anymore).  

In the same place, you will also be able to and pin a conversation you are following up (or unpin it).  

A list of all your group chats, will be displayed in the "Group chats" option of the "Connect" section. To answer messages in a group conversation, just look for it on the list, click on the one you want to resume and, on the right frame, type your message in the text box and click on the black "Send" button.  

## Notes  

You can use the formatting options at the bottom to make your message easily readable. Also, notice that a red dot will appear next to those chats with unread messages.
