# How can I send a direct message?

## Problem

I am an investor and I need to solve a short and fast doubt with a company in my network. I want to send a direct message to the company, but I don't know how to do it.

## Solution

There are three types of chats in the messaging system: direct chats, group chats and relay chats. Direct chats are one-on-one conversations between two users. Those are personal to the users in the conversation and won't be shown to the other team members in the workspace.  

You can send a direct message to anyone in your network, whether they are in the same workspace or not. Direct messages are an easy way to solve simple doubts, request changes or updates in shared documents, etc. 

To **write a direct message**, you can either:  

1. Sign in to your OnePass account,
2. Go to the "Connect" section in the main left side menu,
3. under the personal inbox, click on the "Direct messages" headine, and
4. click on the black "Write a message" button at the bottom left side of the screen.

Or, you can also:

1. Sign in to your OnePass account,
2. Go to the "Connect" section in the main left side menu, and
3. click on the "plus" icon to the right of the "Direct messages" headline.

Once the new mwssage window opens, type few characters to search for the person you want to send a message to, write your message and click on the black "next" button at the bottom right side of the window.  

You can also start a conversation from the results list of a search, by selecting a company and cliking on the "Send message" button that will appear at the bottom or from a company's profile, by clicking on the "Connect" button on the upper part of the profile.

## Notes  

A list of all your direct messages chats, will be displayed in the "Direct messages" option of the "Connect" section. To answer messages in that conversation, just look for it on the list, click on the kone you want to resume and, on the right frame, type your message in the text box and click on the black "Send" button.  

You can use the formatting options at the bottom to make your message easily readable and pin a conversation you are following up (by clicking the three dots icons in the upper right corner and selecting "Pin"). From this same place, you will also be able to unpin a chat.  

Notice that a red dot will appear next to those chats with unread messages and that, if someone outside your network sends you a message, you will receive a notification in the "Chat requests".
