# How can I get in touch with a company that it is not in my network?  

## Problem  

I am an investor and I want to get in touch with a company that is not in my network. How can I do that?  

## Solution  

As an investor, you will receive in your "Pitch Relay Inbox" the pitches that match your investment criteria and will be offered to get in touch with those companies you are interested in. But you can also proactively trigger your own startups' discovery through the "Source" section, either filtering them in the search or browsing the public lists.  

These are company's messages and will appear in the "Connect" section, under the "Company inbox" option.

You can get in touch with any of them following this steps:  

1. Sign-in to your OnePass account,
2. Go to the "Source" section in the main left side menu,
3. Click on the "Companies" option in the left side menu,
4. Use the filters to segment the companies that you are interested in, and  
5. from the results list, select the company you want to contact (by clicking to the left of its name),
6. click on the "Send message" button of the bar that will appear at the bottom of the screen, and
7. once the new message window opens, write your message and click on the black "next" button at the bottom right side of the window.

You can send them an email instead of a message (use the "Send email" button on the bar) and also you can send the same email to more than one company at once (to select multiple companies, press the control key while selecting them).  

If you are rather browsing a list, you can contact companies in that list by clicking on their card to display their profile and, once there, clicking on the "Connect" button in the upper right area of the profile.  

## Notes  

The messages sent related to the Pitch Relay will be shown in the "Connect" section, under the "Relay" chats option.
