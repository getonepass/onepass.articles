# How to accept or deny access requests to my company documents?  

## Problem  

One of the investors with whom I am connected has requested access to one of my company documents. I want to know how to accept this request.

## Solution  

When a user requests access to one of your company documents, you will receive an email notification. Click on the link and follow these steps to accept or deny the request:

1. Sign in to your OnePass account,  
2. Go to the "Documents Hub" option of the left side menu,  
3. In the list of documents, identify and click on the document for which you received the access request (it will be mentioned in the email notification),  
4. Go to the tab "Links and Access Requests" of the document,  
5. To the right of the request you want to manage, you will find buttons to grant read or access permissions. Click the corresponding button as per your preference.

You can also deny the request, by clicking on the three dots icon (to the right of the buttons) and selecting the "Reject" option.  

## Notes  

For each request you receive, you will see the username, the name of the person requesting access and the email address of the user. Click on the username if you want to see the profile of the user who requested access and to which organization he/she belongs.  

Respond promptly to your access requests. Do not allow the interest of your investors to fade away!
