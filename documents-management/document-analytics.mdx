# How can I track the activity in my company's documents?

## Problem  

Some of the investors with whom I am connected requested access to my company documents some time ago. None of them hasn't come back yet about it and I would like to know if the documents were viewed or not.  

## Solution  

To track the activity in a specific document of your company, follow these steps:  

1. Sign in to your OnePass account,  1. Sign in to your OnePass account,
2. Go to the "Documents Hub" option of the left side menu,  
3. In the list of documents, identify and click on the document you want to track,  
4. Go to the "Analytics" tab of the document.

In this tab, you will see a graphic representing the total of views that the document received and the number of unique users who viewed it in the last 30 days.
