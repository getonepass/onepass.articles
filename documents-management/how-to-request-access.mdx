## Problem  

I want to access a document that is not public, but I don't know how to request access to it.  

## Solution  

To request access to a document, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your OnePass account,  
2. Search for the company whose document you want to access,  
3. Go to the "Company documents" tab under company information,  
4. Identify the document you want to access on the list, and  
5. click on the "Request access" button next to it.  

You will see a confirmation message indicating that your request has been sent successfully.

The document owner will receive a notification about your request, and they can approve or deny it. It may take some time for them to respond, so please be patient.  

You will receive an email notification once your request has been processed.
