# How to upload a new version of a document?  

## Problem  

I uploaded an executive summary document some time ago and I want to upload a new version of it. How can I do this?  

## Solution  

To upload a new version of a document, you can do it from the "Documents Hub" section of your OnePass account. Follow these steps:  

1. Sign in to your OnePass account,  
2. Click on the option "Documents Hub" in the left side menu,  
3. Identify the document you want to update, and click on the three dots icon on the right side of the document name,  
4. Select the option "Upload new version",  
5. Choose the new document file from your computer, and click on "Upload".  

You can also upload a new version from the document page:  

1. Once in the "Documents Hub", click on the document name,  
2. Click on the "Upload new version" button in the left side above the document history section,  
3. Select the new document file from your computer, and click on "Open".  

The new version of the document will be uploaded and listed in the document history section. The new version will be archived and can be accessed by clicking on the "View history" button.

## Notes  

The new version uploaded will become the current version of the document. If you want to restore the previous version as the current one, click on the button "Restore" to the right of the name of the version.  
Streamline your fundraising process and enhance investor relations by ensuring these key documents are always ready and up-to-date.
