# How to share a document with someone?

## Problem  

I have created a document to explain our go-to-market strategy and I have uploaded it to my profile. I want to share this document with a mentor so that he can review it and provide feedback. How can I do this?

## Solution  

You can share essential documents like your business plan, pitch deck, and cap table with your investors, mentors, or advisors. This way, you can ask for their feedback and contributions to improve your documents. To share a document, follow these steps:  

1. Sign in to your OnePass account,  
2. Click on the option "Documents Hub" in the left side menu,  
3. Identify the file you want to share in the list and click on its name,  
4. Click on the "Create Link" button,
5. Define with whom you want to share the link by selecting the option "Anyone with the link" or "People with password",
6. Provide a name and a description for the link and a password if you selected the option "People with password",
7. Activate the radio buttoms according your preference to:
    - Request email verification from the recipient to access the document,  
    - Grant permission the people with the link to edit the document,  
    - Allow the recipient to download the document,  
    - Enable the people accessing to provide feedback on the document,
8. Define an expiry date for the link,
9. Click the "Add link" button.

Once the link created you will see it in the list of active links of the document (it will be active until the expiry date you defined or until you archive or delete it). By clicking on the three dots icon to the right, you can copy the link url and share it with the people you want.  

## Notes  

It's possible to edit the link settings at any time by clicking on the three dots icon to the right of the link name. From this same icon, you can also preview the file and archive or delete the link if you no longer need it.
